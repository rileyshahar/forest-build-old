}</meta></frontmatter> <mainmatter><p>The third edition of this well known text continues to provide a solid
foundation in mathematical analysis for undergraduate and first-year graduate
students. The text begins with a discussion of the real number system as a
complete ordered field. (Dedekind's construction is now treated in an appendix
to Chapter I.) The topological background needed for the development of
convergence, continuity, differentiation and integration is provided in Chapter
2. There is a new section on the gamma function, and many new and interesting
exercises are included.</p></mainmatter> <backmatter><contributions/> <context/> <related/> <backlinks/> <references/></backmatter></tree>
